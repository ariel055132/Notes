# LLM Wiki Lint Skill

## Purpose
Run a structural and logical health check of the wiki, then coordinate and apply agreed fixes.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the operator asks to health-check the wiki, or periodically (e.g., after every 10 ingests or when the wiki feels unwieldy).

## Inputs

- Optional: specific area to focus on (e.g., "check for contradictions in the AI section").

## Checks

### 1. Contradictions

- Scan for claims on different pages that conflict.
- Look for: opposite facts, inconsistent dates, contradictory opinions attributed to the same source.
- Report each contradiction with: page A, page B, the conflicting claims, and severity (high/medium/low).

### 2. Stale Claims

- Identify assertions that newer sources have superseded.
- Look for: outdated statistics, deprecated technologies, revised theories.
- Report with: page, claim, why it's stale, and what should replace it.

### 3. Orphan Pages

- Find pages with no inbound wikilinks.
- A page is an orphan if no other page links to it.
- Report with: page name, reason it might be orphaned, and suggested pages to link from.

### 4. Missing Pages

- Identify important concepts or entities mentioned in existing pages but lacking their own dedicated page.
- Report with: where it's mentioned, why it deserves a page, and suggested page type (entity/concept).

### 5. Broken Links

- Find wikilinks pointing to non-existent pages.
- Report with: source page, broken link text, and suggested fix (create page or remove link).

### 6. Data Gaps

- Note areas where additional sources or web search could fill holes.
- Report with: topic, why it's important, and suggested sources or searches.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Run schema checker first**: `python scripts/lint_schema.py --wiki-root wiki --json-out verification/lint-schema-report.json --strict` to validate frontmatter, headings, source paths, and `## Related` cross-links.
2. **Scan all pages** in `wiki/` (excluding templates) for semantic lint checks.
3. **Run each check** above, documenting findings.
4. **Produce a lint report**.
   - Can be a temporary synthesis page in `wiki/syntheses/` or inline in chat.
   - Group findings by check type.
   - Rate each finding by severity (high/medium/low).
5. **Discuss fixes with the operator**.
   - Present findings.
   - Suggest specific fixes.
   - Ask for confirmation before applying.
6. **Apply agreed fixes**.
7. **Append an entry to `wiki/log.md`**.
   - Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | Wiki health check`
   - Include: checks run, issues found, fixes applied, open questions.

## Output Contract

- Report lists all found issues with severity.
- Agreed fixes are applied.
- `wiki/log.md` is updated.

## Guardrails

- Do not delete pages without operator confirmation.
- Do not fix contradictions by removing older claims; instead, add context about how understanding has evolved.
- Prioritize high-severity issues (contradictions, broken links) over cosmetic ones.
- If the wiki is very large, focus on a specific subset or ask the operator for priorities.
