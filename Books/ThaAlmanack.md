1. Find and build specific knowledge

## Specific Knowledge
1. Knowledge you cannot be trained for
2. Found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now
3. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others
4. Taught through apprenticeships, not schools
5. Often high technical or creative, it cannot be outsourced or automated
