# 973. K Closest Points To Origin

## Content

* Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.
* The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2`).

* You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

```text
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```



## Solution 1: Sort

1. Sort the points by distance.
2. Take the closest K points.

* Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of array points
* Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        int N = points.length;
        int[] dists = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            dists[i] = dist(points[i]);

        Arrays.sort(dists);
        int distK = dists[K-1];

        int[][] ans = new int[K][2];
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            if (dist(points[i]) <= distK)
                ans[t++] = points[i];
        return ans;
    }

    public int dist(int[] point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }
}
```
