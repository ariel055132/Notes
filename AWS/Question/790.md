# Question 790
## Question
* A company's web application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud recently increased in popularity. The web application currently exists on a single Amazon EC2 instance in a single public subnet. The web application has not been able to meet the demand of the increased web traffic.
* The company needs a solution that will *provide high availability and scalability* to meet the increased user demand *without rewriting the web application*.
* Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

## Option
* A. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger compute optimized instance.
* B. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets.
* C. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to handle web requests.
* D. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger memory optimized instance.
* E. Configure an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute web traffic.

## Answer
* B. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets.
* E. Configure an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute web traffic.

## Explanation
1. B. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets.
   * *High Availability*: Deploying instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) ensures that if one AZ fails, the application remains available in the other AZs. This is a fundamental principle of building a highly available architecture on AWS.
   * *Scalability*: EC2 Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. When traffic increases, it can launch more instances to handle the load (scaling out). When traffic decreases, it can terminate instances to save costs (scaling in). This addresses the need for scalability to meet increased user demand.
   * *Security*: Placing the EC2 instances in private subnets is a security best practice. This prevents direct inbound internet traffic from reaching the application servers. The only way to access the instances is through a load balancer or a NAT gateway for outbound traffic.
2. E. Configure an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute web traffic.
   * *Scalability and High Availability*: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a managed service that automatically distributes incoming web traffic across multiple targets, such as the EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group. It's highly available by design, as it's a regional service that operates across multiple AZs. It acts as the single point of contact for all web traffic, directing it only to healthy instances.
   * *Security*: The ALB sits in a public subnet, where it can receive traffic from the internet, and then securely forwards that traffic to the private instances. This architecture shields the application servers from direct internet exposure.


## Thinking
* Option A 不選的原因是它無法提供 high availability，因為只是單純提高單一 instance 的容量，當這個 instance crash 掉的時候，就沒有額外的 instance 可以提供支援 (single point of failure)
* Option D 其實與 Option A 同理
* Option C 這個選項看起來很怪，因為 NAT 的主要用途其實是給在 private network 的 instance 可以存取 public internet 的 resources，同時隔絕 public internet 的 request 打到 private network 的 instance，但 Option C 這個就不是這個用法，因此先拒絕此用法
* 選 Option B 和 Option E
