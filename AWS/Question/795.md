# Question 795
## Question
* A company is designing a *tightly coupled high performance computing (HPC) environment* in the AWS Cloud. The company needs to include features that will *optimize the HPC environment for networking and storage*.
* Which combination of solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 

## Option
* A. Create an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Configure custom routing for the accelerator.
* B. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Configure the file system with scratch storage. 
* C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the viewer protocol policy to be HTTP and HTTPS.
* D. Launch Amazon EC2 instances. Attach an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) to the instances.
* E. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment to manage the environment.

## Answer
* B. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Configure the file system with scratch storage. 
* D. Launch Amazon EC2 instances. Attach an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) to the instances.

## Explanation
1. A. Create an accelerator in *AWS Global Accelerator*. Configure custom routing for the accelerator.
   * AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the availability and performance of applications for global users by directing traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint over the AWS global network.
   * Not designed for low-latency, inter-node communication required for a tightly coupled HPC cluster within a single region
2. **B. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Configure the file system with scratch storage.** 
   * FSx for Lustre that is designed for temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data.
   * A cost-effective option for HPC jobs where data is not required to persist after the job is complete.
3. C. Create an *Amazon CloudFront distribution*. Configure the viewer protocol policy to be HTTP and HTTPS.
   * Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used to deliver content to end users with low latency by caching it at edge locations
   * Not Relevant to HPC cluster
4. **D. Launch Amazon EC2 instances. Attach an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) to the instances.**
   * *Networking Optimization*: The key to a tightly coupled HPC environment is low-latency, high-throughput inter-node communication. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that is purpose-built for this.
   * *How EFA works*: It uses a custom-built OS-bypass hardware interface that allows HPC applications (like those using Message Passing Interface or MPI) to communicate directly with the network hardware. This bypasses the operating system's TCP/IP stack, which significantly reduces latency and improves network performance. This is the "gold standard" for high-performance networking in the AWS cloud for HPC workloads.
5. E. Create an *AWS Elastic Beanstalk* deployment to manage the environment.
   * Used for deploying and managing web application and service
   * Simplify deployment process, not designed for HPC environment
