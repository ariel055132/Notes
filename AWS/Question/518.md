# Question 518
## Question 
* An application uses an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The RDS database is becoming *low on disk space*. A solutions architect wants to *increase the disk space without downtime*.
* Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?

## Option
* A. Enable storage autoscaling in RDS
* B. Increase the RDS database instance size
* C. Change the RDS database instance storage type to Provisioned IOPS
* D. Back up the RDS database, increase the storage capacity, restore the database, and stop the previous instance

## Answer
* A. Enable storage autoscaling in RDS

## Explanation
1. B. Increase the RDS database instance size
   * This changes *compute capacity*, not storage.
   * Also may require a restart, causing downtime.
2. C. Change storage type to Provisioned IOPS
   * improves *performance*, not disk capacity.
3. D. Backup → Increase storage → Restore
   * manual, time-consuming, and causes downtime.
4. A. Enable storage autoscaling in RDS
   * RDS storage autoscaling automatically increases the allocated storage for your RDS DB instance when it is running low on space.
   * It only needs to be enabled once for an RDS instance, and then it will scale as needed.
