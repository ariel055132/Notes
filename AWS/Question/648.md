# Question 648
## Question
* A weather forecasting company needs to process hundreds of gigabytes of data with sub-millisecond latency. The company has a *high performance computing (HPC) environment* in its data center and wants to expand its forecasting capabilities.
* A solutions architect must identify a highly available cloud storage solution that can handle large amounts of sustained throughput. Files that are stored in the solution should be accessible to thousands of compute instances that will simultaneously access and process the entire dataset.
* What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

## Option
* A.Use Amazon FSx for Lustre scratch file systems
* B.Use Amazon FSx for Lustre persistent file systems
* C.Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Bursting Throughput mode.
* D.Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode.

## Answer
* B.Use Amazon FSx for Lustre persistent file systems

## Explanation
1. A. FSx for Lustre (scratch)
   * Designed for temporary storage, short-term processing, and does not support high availability.
2. C. EFS with Bursting Throughput
   * Meant for general-purpose workloads, not HPC.
   * Throughput scales with size, but not enough for sustained HPC throughput.
   * Higher latency (milliseconds), which is too slow for this case.
3. D. EFS with Provisioned Throughput
   * Offers better performance than bursting, but still not on the level of FSx for Lustre.
   * Still has higher latency and lower throughput compared to FSx for Lustre.
   * EFS is POSIX-compliant NFS, not optimized for massive parallel I/O in HPC.

## Thinking
* 題目有提到 High performance computing (HPC) environment，基本上用 FSx for Lustre，只剩下 Option A 和 B 在選
* 兩者之間的差別是一個是 Scratch / Persistent
* Scratch File Systems (temporary)
  * No high durability - data is lost if the file system is deleted or fails. Not backed by durable storage. 
  * Not highly available – no replication or fault tolerance.
  * Cheaper than persistent, as there’s no data replication or backup.
  * Data does not survive instance or system failure.
  * Use Case: Temporary workloads such as short-term data processing, ETL jobs, or transient HPC runs.
* Persistent File Systems (Durable)
  * High Durability - data is stored on Amazon S3 and persists after file system termination.
  * Highly available – supports automatic replication and fault tolerance.
  * More expensive than scratch due to durability features and S3-backed storage.
  * Data survives failures and reboots.
  * Use Case: Forecasting systems, research pipelines, or ML training jobs that need to retain data or run continuously.
* 根據以上定義與 Use Case，選 Option B 比較合理
