# Question 689
## Question
* A company wants to standardize its Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume *encryption strategy*. The company also wants to *minimize the cost and configuration effort required to operate the volume encryption check*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Options
* A.Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule an AWS Lambda function to run the API calls.
* B.Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Run the API calls on an AWS Fargate task.
* C.Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that requires the use of tags on EBS volumes. Use AWS Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Encrypt the untagged resources manually.
* D.Create an AWS Config rule for Amazon EBS to evaluate if a volume is encrypted and to flag the volume if it is not encrypted.

## Answers
* D.Create an AWS Config rule for Amazon EBS to evaluate if a volume is encrypted and to flag the volume if it is not encrypted.

## Explanation
1. A. Lambda + EventBridge + API calls
   * Works, but it requires you to write and maintain custom code and schedules.
   * More operational effort than using AWS Config.
2. B. Fargate task with API calls (Incorrect)
   * Overkill for this purpose
   * Higher cost and complexity than necessary.
3. C. IAM policy + Cost Explorer
   * IAM tagging policies do not enforce encryption.
   * Cost Explorer shows usage and cost data, not encryption status
