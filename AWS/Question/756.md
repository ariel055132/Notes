# Question 756
## Question
* A company stores text files in Amazon S3. The text files include customer chat messages, date and time information, and customer personally identifiable information (PII).
* The company needs a solution to provide samples of the conversations to an external service provider for quality control. The external service provider needs to randomly pick sample conversations up to the most recent conversation. The company must *not share the customer PII with the external service provider*. The solution must *scale when the number of customer conversations increases*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST operational overhead*?


## Option
* A. Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts  the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.
* B. Create a batch process on an Amazon EC2 instance that regularly reads all new files, redacts the PII from the files, and writes the redacted files to a different S3 bucket. Instruct the external service provider to access the bucket that does not contain the PII.
* B. Create a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance that presents a list of the files, redacts the PII from the files, and allows the external service provider to download new versions of the files that have the PII redacted.
* D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create an AWS Lambda function that reads only the data in the files that does not contain PII. Configure the Lambda function to store the non-PII data in the DynamoDB table when a new file is written to Amazon S3. Grant the external service provider access to the DynamoDB table

## Answer
* A. Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts  the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.

## Explanation
* Why Other Options Are Incorrect:
  1. B. This solution involves creating a batch process on an EC2 instance to create separate, redacted copies of the files. This introduces significant operational overhead, as you have to manage the EC2 instance, the batch script, and the storage for the redacted files. It also requires the creation of duplicate data, which is inefficient.
  2. C. This solution requires building and managing a web application on an EC2 instance. This is highly inefficient from an operational perspective. You have to maintain the EC2 instance, the web application code, and the underlying infrastructure. It is also less scalable than a serverless solution, as you would need to implement and manage your own auto-scaling logic.
  3. D. This approach involves reading the non-PII data into a separate DynamoDB table. This is not a viable solution for several reasons:
    * It requires creating and maintaining a separate data store (the DynamoDB table).
    * It only works if you can extract and store all the non-PII data in a structured format, which may not be the case for customer chat messages.
    * It does not provide the full conversation to the external provider, which is a requirement for quality control. It only provides the non-PII data that was specifically extracted and stored.
