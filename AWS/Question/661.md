# Question 661
## Question
* A company runs applications on AWS that connect to the company's Amazon RDS database. The applications *scale on weekends and at peak times of the year*. The company wants to *scale the database more effectively for its applications that connect to the database*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST operational overhead*?

## Options
* A.Use Amazon DynamoDB with connection pooling with a target group configuration for the database. Change the applications to use the DynamoDB endpoint
* B.Use Amazon RDS Proxy with a target group for the database. Change the applications to use the RDS Proxy endpoint.
* C.Use a custom proxy that runs on Amazon EC2 as an intermediary to the database. Change the applications to use the custom proxy endpoint
* D.Use an AWS Lambda function to provide connection pooling with a target group configuration for the database. Change the applications to use the Lambda function

## Answers
* B.Use Amazon RDS Proxy with a target group for the database. Change the applications to use the RDS Proxy endpoint.

## Explanation
1. A. Use DynamoDB with connection pooling (wrong)
   * DynamoDB is a NoSQL database — not a drop-in replacement for RDS (which is SQL-based).
   * Requires a complete application rewrite.
   * Not applicable if relational features (joins, SQL queries) are required.
2. C. Custom EC2-based proxy (wrong)
   * Requires you to build, scale, and manage the proxy yourself.
   * Introduces operational overhead for monitoring, patching, scaling, and HA.
   * No built-in integration with RDS failover and IAM. (wrong)
3. D. Lambda for connection pooling
   * AWS Lambda is not ideal for managing persistent database connections.
   * Lambda has a concurrent execution limit and ephemeral runtime, which makes connection pooling inefficient.
     * 15 mins processing time
     * 10GB ram limit
   * Adds complexity and not designed for persistent, pooled access to RDS.
4. B. RDS Proxy (correct)
   * Manages and pools database connections
   * Improves scalability by reducing the database load from rapid connection creation/destruction 
   * Requires minimal changes to applications — just update the connection endpoint 
   * Fully managed by AWS, meaning least operational overhead 


## Thinking
* 那時候是 Option A, C 先排除掉
* Option A 排除的原因：DynamoDB 只支援 noSQL，而 RDS 可能包含 noSQL / mySQL & PostgreSQL，直接使用 DynamoDB 可能導致不包容
* Option C 排除的原因：Custom EC2 基本上就需要大量的 Operation Effort..
* 所以剩 Option B, Option D，Option B 比起 Option D 一定不需要那麼多 Operational Overhead，因此先選 Option B
