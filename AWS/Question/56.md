# Question 56
## Question
* A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate so that the *third-party services can use HTTPS*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Option
* A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
* B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
* C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's "Endpoint-URL" and "Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
* D.Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.

## Answer
* C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.

## Explanation
* The Correct Steps:
  1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: The company's APIs are in the ca-central-1 Region, so a Regional endpoint is the appropriate type. This type of endpoint serves traffic from within a specific AWS Region.
  2. Import the certificate into ACM in the same Region: For a Regional API Gateway endpoint, the TLS/SSL certificate must reside in the same AWS Region as the API Gateway. This is a critical requirement. The certificate, which is used to enable HTTPS, is managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
  3. Associate the custom domain name and certificate with the API Gateway endpoint: In the API Gateway console, you create a Custom Domain Name. You provide your company's domain name (e.g., api.example.com) and then select the certificate you imported into ACM. This creates a public DNS record (a CNAME) provided by API Gateway.
  4. Configure Route 53 to route traffic: The final step is to tell Route 53 to send traffic for your custom domain name to the API Gateway endpoint. You do this by creating a DNS record in your Route 53 hosted zone. You'll typically use an Alias record, which points to the API Gateway's unique domain name, allowing Route 53 to route traffic efficiently and automatically handle IP changes.
