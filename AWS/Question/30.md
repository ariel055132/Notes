# Question 30
## Question
* A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. *The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database*. The team wants to *reduce the cost of running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance*.
* Which solution meets these requirements *MOST cost-effectively*?

## Options
* A.Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.
B.Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed.
C.Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
D.Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required.

## Answer
* C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.

## Explanation
* Looking for the most cost-effective way to run resource-intensive, infrequent (monthly) tests on an RDS for MySQL DB instance without compromising on compute/memory capacity during tests:
  1. Creating a snapshot preserves the DB state.
  2. Terminating the DB instance stops all compute and memory costs.
  3. When needed, you can restore the snapshot to the same high-capacity DB instance just for the 48-hour test window.
  4. You only pay for the storage cost of the snapshot while the DB is terminated — a significant cost savings.
* A. Stop the DB instance
  * RDS doesn’t support stopping MySQL DB instances unless they are in a Multi-AZ setup with Amazon RDS on Amazon EC2. Even when stopping is allowed, you still pay for storage — but it doesn’t eliminate compute costs like terminating does. 
* B. Auto Scaling with RDS
  * RDS does not support Auto Scaling for compute/memory. This is only for Aurora Serverless or EC2, not standard RDS MySQL.
* D. Modify to low-capacity
  * Frequent modifications between instance classes incur downtime and operational complexity, and you still pay for the low-capacity instance year-round, which is more costly than terminating it entirely.


## Thinking
* 覺得蠻難判斷的..
* Option A 其實有一點成本，因為 Stop Instance ，Users 仍然需要付錢進行相關 instance 儲存 (因為並非 delete/terminate instance...)
* Option D 感覺和 Option A 差不多(?) 雖然將 instance 放到 low-capacity 確實是能降低一些成本，但仍然需要付錢...
* Option B 感覺不太相關。。
