# Question 786
## Question
* A company runs multiple workloads in its on-premises data center. The company's data center cannot scale fast enough to meet the company's expanding business needs. The company wants to collect usage and configuration data about the on-premises servers and workloads to plan a migration to AWS.
* Which solution will meet these requirements? 

## Option
* A.Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Systems Manager to collect data about the on-premises servers.
* B.Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Application Discovery Service to collect data about the on-premises servers.
* C.Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to collect data about the on-premises servers.
* D.Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to collect data about the on-premises servers.

## Answer
* B.Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Application Discovery Service to collect data about the on-premises servers.

## Explanation
1. A. Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Systems Manager to collect data about the on-premises servers.
   * While *AWS Systems Manager* can manage on-premises servers, its primary function is *not for comprehensive discovery and migration planning*. It's more about *operational management* (patching, configuration, automation).
2. B. Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Application Discovery Service to collect data about the on-premises servers.
   * *AWS Migration Hub*: This is a central, single place to discover your existing on-premises servers, plan migrations, and track the status of your application migrations.
   * *AWS Application Discovery Service*: This is the specific service designed for the exact problem described in the question: "collect usage and configuration data about the on-premises servers and workloads
3. C. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to collect data about the on-premises servers.
   * *AWS Schema Conversion Tool* (AWS SCT) is specifically for database migration. It analyzes source database schemas and converts them to a format compatible with the target AWS database. It does not collect general server configuration or usage data.
   * *AWS Trusted Advisor* provides best practice recommendations for cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerance within your AWS environment. It has no functionality to collect data from on-premises servers.
4. D. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to collect data about the on-premises servers.
   * AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a service used to migrate databases to AWS

## Thinking
* 由於題目沒有提及到 database 的 migration，所以基本上可以先忽略 Option C 和 Option D，因為用到 Schema Conversion Tool 的機率不大
* 所以是卡在到底選 Option A，還是 Option B
* 然後 Option A 和 Option B 不同的是，前者使用 Systems Manager，後者使用 Application Discovery Service
* 忽略了前者的 System Manager 是管理日常使用的部分，後者才是 for migration
