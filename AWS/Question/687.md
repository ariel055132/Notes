# Question 687
## Question
* A company that uses AWS needs a solution to *predict the resources needed for manufacturing processes each month*. The solution must use historical values that are currently stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has *no machine learning (ML) experience* and wants to use a managed service for the training and predictions.
* Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

## Option
* A.Deploy an Amazon SageMaker model. Create a SageMaker endpoint for inference.
* B.Use Amazon SageMaker to train a model by using the historical data in the S3 bucket.
* C.Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses Amazon SageMaker endpoints to create predictions based on the inputs.
* D.Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses an Amazon Forecast predictor to create a prediction based on the inputs.
* E.Train an Amazon Forecast predictor by using the historical data in the S3 bucket

## Answer
* D.Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses an Amazon Forecast predictor to create a prediction based on the inputs.
* E.Train an Amazon Forecast predictor by using the historical data in the S3 bucket

## Explanation
* Situation
  1. The company has no ML experience
  2. The company needs to predict resources for manufacturing
  3. The company has historical data in Amazon S3
  4. The company wants a fully managed service for training and predictions

1. D. Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses an Amazon Forecast predictor to create a prediction based on the inputs.
  * Amazon Forecast is purpose-built for time series forecasting (like monthly resource planning). You can use Lambda to integrate with Forecast’s predictor for inference.
2. E. Train an Amazon Forecast predictor by using the historical data in the S3 bucket
  * Forecast can be trained directly using CSV files in S3. It automatically handles feature engineering, training, and tuning—ideal for teams with no ML expertise.

* Incorrect Option
  1. A. 
    * SageMaker requires more ML knowledge and setup, including selecting algorithms and configuring endpoints—not ideal for users with no ML experience. 
  2. B.
    * Again, SageMaker is powerful, but not the best fit for users seeking a no-code or low-code forecasting tool.
  3. C.
    * While it is technically possible, Amazon Forecast is the better service for predictions in this use case compared to SageMaker, and using SageMaker here adds unnecessary complexity.


## Thinking
* 那時候選了 A,B ..
* 因為不知道什麼是 AWS Forecast Predictor，只知道 SageMaker 是專門讓 Developer 對 ML model 進行處理的服務
* 因此只在 Option A-C 之間選，然後SageMaker可以直接從 AWS source中抽取資料進行訓練。最後再 Deploy 相關 SageMaker model endpoint。
* 因此選 A, B
* 忽略了 SageMaker 服務需要 User 有 ML 的經驗
