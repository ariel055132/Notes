# Question 637
## Question
* A solutions architect is designing a new service behind Amazon API Gateway. The request patterns for the service will be unpredictable and can change suddenly from 0 requests to over 500 per second. The total size of the data that needs to be persisted in a backend database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth. Data can be queried using simple key-value requests.
* Which combination of AWS services would meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

## Options
* A.AWS Fargate
* B.AWS Lambda
* C.Amazon DynamoDB
* D.Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
* E.MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora

## Answer
* B. AWS Lambda
* C. Amazon DynamoDB

## Explanation
* The scenario describes a serverless, highly scalable, low-latency backend that must:
  * Handle bursty, unpredictable traffic (from 0 to 500+ requests/sec)
  * Persist less than 1 GB of data (and potentially grow)
  * Support simple key-value lookups
  * Require low operational overhead
* B. AWS Lambda
  * Scales automatically with request volume.
  * Perfect for unpredictable workloads — no pre-provisioning needed.
  * Works seamlessly with API Gateway.
  * Serverless = minimal operational overhead.
* C. Amazon DynamoDB
  * A fully managed NoSQL key-value store.
  * Supports on-demand capacity to handle sudden spikes.
  * Ideal for small-to-medium datasets that might grow.
  * Excellent latency and performance under variable load.

1. A. AWS Fargate
   * More suitable for running containers, not ideal for short-lived API calls
   * While it is scalable, it has more latency and overhead than Lambda for this use case.
2. D. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
   * Requires managing instances, provisioning, and scaling logic.
   * Adds operational overhead and slower to scale for spiky workloads.
3. E. MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora
   * Aurora is powerful, but not optimal for simple key-value access.
   * More complex to manage than DynamoDB.
   * Scaling can be slower and more expensive for highly variable workloads.

## Thinking
* 基本上選 Option C，然後這樣子就排除 E 了
* 為什麼選 Option C 的原因是：題目講到 queries 都是 key-value，基本上聯想應該用 redis 這種key-value 這種 DB 比較好，這種 DB 都被歸類為 noSQL，基本上用 DynamoDB
* Aurora 與 MySQL, PostgreSQL 這種 Relational Database 相關
* 那這樣就只剩 Option A, B, D 要選
* Option A 先排除的原因是 Fargate 比較適合在建立 Serverless Application，但題目只是要提供 API call，用它好像有點 Over kill
* Option B, D 在選，那時候看到題目說 backend database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth，然後覺得 Lambda 最大是 10GB，然後最多處理 15 分鐘的任務，覺得之後會不會因為 future growth 的關係，導致它不能使用
* 因此選擇 Option D

## Reference
* but the questions mentions that the database is currently less than 1Gb but with unpredictable future growth, is it reasonable for using AWS Lambda?
* Lambda itself is not responsible for storing data — it executes code. The database (in this case, Amazon DynamoDB) is where the data lives.
* So when the question says “database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth,” this refers to the backend database (like DynamoDB), not Lambda itself.
