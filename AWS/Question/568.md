# Question 568
## Question
* A solutions architect is designing the storage architecture for a new web application used for storing and viewing engineering drawings. All application components will be deployed on the AWS infrastructure.
* The application design must support caching to minimize the amount of time that users wait for the engineering drawings to load. The application must be able to store petabytes of data.
* Which combination of storage and caching should the solutions architect use?

## Option
* A.Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront
* B.Amazon S3 Glacier with Amazon ElastiCache
* C.Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes with Amazon CloudFront
* D.AWS Storage Gateway with Amazon ElastiCache

## Answer 
* A. Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront

## Explanation
1. B. Amazon S3 Glacier + Amazon ElastiCache
   * S3 Glacier is for archival, not for frequently accessed content — retrieval can take minutes or hours.
   * ElastiCache is good for in-memory key-value data, not large file caching.
2. C. Amazon EBS volumes + Amazon CloudFront
   * CloudFront cannot directly serve content from EBS.
   * EBS is block storage for use with EC2 — not designed for scalable object storage or caching.
3. D. AWS Storage Gateway + Amazon ElastiCache
   * Storage Gateway is for hybrid environments (on-prem ↔ AWS) — not needed in this fully cloud-based app.
   * ElastiCache still doesn’t help with static file delivery.


## Thinking
* 基本上排除 B，因為 S3 Glacier 是用來儲存歷史資料，不適合讓 User 進行即時操作
* Option D 的 Storage Gateway 主要是進行 Hybrid 的儲存 (Local + Cloud)
* CloudFront 反過來想其實是可以做為類 Cache 使用
* 因為 User 對 CloudFront 執行資料存取時，CloudFront 會先看自己內部有沒有對應檔案，若有，先給對應檔案，沒有才往上一層拿
