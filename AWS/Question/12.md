# Question 12
## Question
* A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to
*improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data*. The company is using its own domain name registered with *Amazon Route 53*
* What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

## Option
* A.Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
* B.Create an *Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin*. Create an *AWS Global Accelerator* standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
* C.Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name as an endpoint for the web application.
* D.Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application

## Answer
* A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

## Explanation
1. B. CloudFront (ALB) + Global Accelerator (S3)
   * setup 有點複雜，因為 Global Accelerator 主要是用於 application 與 AWS 服務之間的連結加速 
2. C. CloudFront (S3) + Global Accelerator (ALB + CloudFront)
   * Mixing CloudFront and Global Accelerator adds unnecessary complexity
   * Adds cost and operational overhead without improving performance meaningfully for this use case.
3. D. CloudFront for dynamic content + Global Accelerator for static + two domains
   * Splitting traffic between two domain names complicates the architecture and client-side logic.
   * Global Accelerator is not ideal for static content delivery; CloudFront is better suited.
