# Question 400
## Question
* A meteorological startup company has a custom web application to sell weather data to its users online. The company uses Amazon *DynamoDB* to store its data and wants to build a new service that *sends an alert to the managers of four internal teams every time a new weather event is recorded*. The company does *not want this new service to affect the performance of the current application*.
* What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

## Options
* A.Use DynamoDB transactions to write new event data to the table. Configure the transactions to notify internal teams.
* B.Have the current application publish a message to four Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Have each team subscribe to one topic.
* C.Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe.
* D.Add a custom attribute to each record to flag new items. Write a cron job that scans the table every minute for items that are new and notifies an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to which the teams can subscribe.

## Answer
* C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe.

## Explanation
* Option A is incorrect because using DynamoDB transactions to write new event data does not provide a mechanism to notify internal teams. Transactions are primarily used for ensuring atomicity and consistency in writes (ACID), not for notifications.
* Option D is incorrect because adding a custom attribute and using a cron job to scan the table every minute introduces unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. It also does not provide real-time notifications.
* Option B is incorrect because while publishing messages to multiple SNS topics could work, it does not scale well and increases operational overhead by requiring the application to manage multiple topics and subscriptions.
* Option C 的 Trigger 並非 DB 的 Trigger，指的是 AWS Lamdba 的 Trigger，目的是通知 SNS 進行相關操作
* 本來以為Option C 的Trigger 是指 DB 的 Trigger...
