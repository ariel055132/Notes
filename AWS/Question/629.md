# Question 629
## Question
* A company runs a production database on Amazon RDS for MySQL. The company wants to upgrade the database version for security compliance reasons. Because the database contains critical data, the company wants a *quick solution to upgrade and test functionality without losing any data*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST operational overhead*?

## Option
* A. Create an RDS manual snapshot. Upgrade to the new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL.
* B. Use native backup and restore. Restore the data to the upgraded new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL.
* C. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the data to the upgraded new version of Amazon RDS for MySQL.
* D. Use Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments to deploy and test production changes

## Answer 
* D. Use Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments to deploy and test production changes

## Explanation
* Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments provide a simple, safe, and fast way to upgrade databases (including major version upgrades) with minimal downtime and no data loss.
* Procedure:
  1. RDS automatically creates a “green” environment that’s a copy of your production (“blue”) database.
  2. Upgrade the engine version in the green environment.
  3. Test the application against the green environment.
  4. Once validated, perform a “switchover”, which typically takes under a minute.
  5. All data changes are continuously replicated from blue to green until switchover.

1. A. Create an RDS manual snapshot and upgrade
   * Requires manual restoration and testing.
   * Snapshot restore doesn’t replicate changes made after the snapshot.
   * More operational effort and potential for data loss or downtime.
2. B. Native backup and restore
   * Manual and time-consuming.
   * Requires handling compatibility, replication, etc.
   * High operational overhead and risk of human error.
3. C. AWS DMS
   * Good for migrations, but complex to set up.
   * More moving parts and not needed for simple version upgrades.
   * Slower and not as seamless as Blue/Green.

## Thinking
* 主要是看不懂什麼是 RDS Blue/Green Deployments...
* 然後只剩 Option A - Option C 在選
* 然後 Option A 不對的原因是：snapshot 只存當下的資料，不會存之後儲存的資料，這有可能導致 data loss
* Option B 不對的原因是：手工 backup 看起來就已經 Operational Overhead 很高
* Option C 那時候在想的是：在需要進行數據遷移的 DB 放一個 DMS Agent，然後開始遷移，基本上人就不需要管了，看起來 Operational Overhead 比 Option A 和 Option B 要低
