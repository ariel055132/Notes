# Question 622
## Question 
* A company is creating a new web application for its subscribers. The *application will consist of a static single page and a persistent database layer*. The application will have *millions of users for 4 hours in the morning, but the application will have only a few thousand users during the rest of the day*. The company's *data architects have requested the ability to rapidly evolve their schema*.
* Which solutions will meet these requirements and provide the MOST scalability? (Choose two.)

## Option
* A.Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Provision on-demand capacity.
* B.Deploy Amazon Aurora as the database solution. Choose the serverless DB engine mode.
* C.Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Ensure that DynamoDB auto scaling is enabled.
* D.Deploy the static content into an Amazon S3 bucket. Provision an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.
* E.Deploy the web servers for static content across a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups. Configure the instances to periodically refresh the content from an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume.

## Answer
* A. Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Provision on-demand capacity.
* D. Deploy the static content into an Amazon S3 bucket. Provision an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.

## Explanation
* This scenario describes:
  * A static web application (single-page app) → optimal for S3 + CloudFront.
  * Massive traffic for a short duration, and low traffic most of the day → needs high scalability with low operational overhead.
  * *The ability to rapidly evolve schema → implies preference for schema-less or flexible-schema database (NoSQL)*.
1. B. Aurora Serverless
   * Aurora Serverless is great for variable workloads and supports SQL, but:
   * Schema changes in relational databases (like Aurora) are not as flexible as in DynamoDB.
   * It may not scale as instantly or cheaply as DynamoDB under unpredictable, bursty loads.
2. C. DynamoDB with auto scaling
   * This is good, but on-demand capacity (Option A) is better for unpredictable, spiky workloads — it reacts faster than auto scaling.
3. E. EC2 + EFS for static content
   * Using EC2 for static web hosting is overkill, less scalable, and more expensive than S3 + CloudFront.
   * Requires more management overhead, defeating the goal of scalability and simplicity.


## Thinking
* 看到題目的 5 個 Option，基本上是 Option A-C 之間選一個；Option D, E 之間選一個
* 看到 static single page，然後看到有 Amazon S3 bucket + CloudFront Distribution，基本上可以選
* 然後 Option E (Amazon EC2 instances) 基本上太 overkill 了
