# Question 75
## Question
* A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that communicate with each other by way of *RESTful services*. 
* *Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded*. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application.
* Which solution meets these requirements and is the *MOST operationally efficient*?

## Option
* A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services
* B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.
* C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.
* D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected

## Answer
* A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the
application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the
communication layer between application services

## Explanation
* Analysis of Incorrect Options:
  1. B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.
    * This solution uses a vertical scaling approach (making instances bigger) which is a short-term fix. It doesn't solve the fundamental issue of the application's architecture causing dropped transactions. It also isn't operationally efficient because you're still managing EC2 instances and paying for oversized instances during off-peak times
  2. C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.
    * *Amazon SNS is a pub/sub messaging service, not a queueing service designed for a buffer between tiers.* It doesn't store messages for later consumption
  3. D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.
    * This is a decent solution that uses SQS to decouple the tiers, which solves the dropped transaction problem. However, it is not the most operationally efficient. You are still managing and paying for Amazon EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups. Option A, by using serverless Lambda and API Gateway, completely removes the need for this operational overhead, making it the superior choice for modernization and operational efficiency.
