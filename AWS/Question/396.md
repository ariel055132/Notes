# Question 396
## Question
* A company has implemented a self-managed DNS service on AWS. The solution consists of the following:
    * Amazon EC2 instances in different AWS Regions
    * Endpoints of a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator
* The company wants to protect the solution against DDoS attacks.
* What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

## Options
* A.Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Add the accelerator as a resource to protect.
* B.Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Add the EC2 instances as resources to protect.
* C.Create an AWS WAF web ACL that includes a rate-based rule. Associate the web ACL
with the accelerator.
* D.Create an AWS WAF web ACL that includes a rate-based rule. Associate the web ACL with the EC2 instances

## Answer
* A. Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Add the accelerator as a resource to protect.

## Explanation
* The company is using **AWS Global Accelerator**, which is designed to improve availability and performance for global applications. *AWS Global Accelerator automatically provides DDoS protection at the edge using AWS Shield, and you can enhance this protection by subscribing to AWS Shield Advanced.*

* B. Add the EC2 instances as resources to protect
  * Shield Advanced does not protect EC2 directly unless traffic is going through Elastic IPs, CloudFront, or Global Accelerator.
  * In this case, EC2 is behind Global Accelerator, so protecting the accelerator is more effective.
* C. Create an AWS WAF web ACL and associate with accelerator
  * Not supported: You cannot associate AWS WAF with Global Accelerator. WAF works with services like CloudFront, ALB, and API Gateway, not Global Accelerator.
* D. Create a WAF rule and associate with EC2
  * Again, WAF cannot be attached directly to EC2 instances. WAF only works with supported services like ALB, API Gateway, etc.
