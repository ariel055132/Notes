# Question 371
## Question
* A company hosts a frontend application that uses an Amazon API Gateway API backend that is integrated with AWS Lambda. When the API receives requests, the Lambda function loads many libraries. Then the Lambda function connects to an Amazon RDS database, processes the data, and returns the data to the frontend application. The company wants to ensure that response latency is as low as possible for all its users with the fewest number of changes to the company's operations.

## Options
* A. Establish a connection between the frontend application and the database to make queries faster by bypassing the API.
* B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function that handles the requests.
* C. Cache the results of the queries in Amazon S3 for faster retrieval of similar datasets.
* D. Increase the size of the database to increase the number of connections Lambda can establish at one time.

## Answer
* B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function that handles the requests.

## Explanation
* When a Lambda function experiences latency due to cold starts (loading libraries, initializing connections, etc.), *provisioned concurrency helps eliminate that issue by keeping a set number of Lambda instances pre-initialized and ready to respond immediately*.
* This is the simplest, most effective way to reduce response latency without requiring significant architectural or operational changes.

* A. Establish a connection between the frontend and the database
  * Security risk: Exposes the database directly to the frontend.
  * Bypasses the API Gateway and Lambda layer, removing important business logic, validation, and security controls.

* C. Cache the results in Amazon S3
  * Storing dynamic or real-time query results in S3 adds complexity.
  * Not effective if data is highly dynamic or user-specific.
  * Does not address the cold start latency of the Lambda function.

* D. Increase the size of the database
  * Expensive and doesnâ€™t directly reduce Lambda cold start latency.
  * Also, database connection count is only one part of the latency; cold start is the primary concern here.
