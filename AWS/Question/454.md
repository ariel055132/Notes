# Question 454
## Question 
* A company has resources across multiple AWS Regions and accounts. A newly hired solutions architect discovers a previous employee did not provide details about the resources inventory. The solutions architect needs to **build and map the relationship details of the various workloads across all accounts**.
* Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?

## Options 
* A.Use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to generate a map view from the detailed view report.
* B.Use AWS Step Functions to collect workload details. Build architecture diagrams of the workloads manually.
* C.Use Workload Discovery on AWS to generate architecture diagrams of the workloads.
* D.Use AWS X-Ray to view the workload details. Build architecture diagrams with relationships.

## Answer
* C. Use Workload Discovery on AWS to generate architecture diagrams of the workloads.

## Explanation
1. A. AWS Systems Manager Inventory
    * It collects *configuration metadata* from managed instances (e.g., EC2, software inventory), but does *not provide architecture diagrams* or full multi-account discovery.
    * Also requires SSM Agent installed and configured, and doesn’t auto-map relationships.
2. B. AWS Step Functions
    * Step Functions is for *building serverless workflows*, not for inventory or discovery.
    * Manual effort is inefficient and error-prone—opposite of operational efficiency.
3. D. AWS X-Ray
    * X-Ray is for *tracing requests through applications*, primarily useful for microservices debugging.
    * It does not map architecture diagrams or resource inventory across accounts.
