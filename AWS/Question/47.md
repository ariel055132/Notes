# Question 47
## Question
* A company needs guaranteed *Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones* in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last *1 week*.
* What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity? 


## Option
* A. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
* B. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
* C. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
* D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

## Answer
* D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.


## Explanation
1. C. Purchase *Reserved Instances* that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
   * While you can purchase RIs that reserve capacity, they are *intended for long-term commitments (1-year or 3-year terms) to save money*. 
   * Using them for a 1-week event would be very expensive and an inefficient use of resources.
   * Also, you would still need to specify the instance type and the Availability Zone for each of the three zones, not just the Region.

## Thinking
* Reserved Instance 需要一次性訂購最少一年的時間，才能省錢
* On-Demand 是隨買隨用
