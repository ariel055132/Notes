# Question 32
## Question
* A development team needs to host a website that will be accessed by other teams. The website contents consist of *HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images*.
* Which method is the *MOST cost-effective* for hosting the website?

## Option
* A.Containerize the website and host it in AWS Fargate.
* B.Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there.
* C.Deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website.
* D.Configure an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target that uses the Express.js framework.

## Answer
* B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there.

## Explanation
* The requirement are:
  * Host a static website 
  * Accsesible by internal user
  * Most cost-effective
1. B. Amazon S3 (correct)
   * Amazon S3 supports static website hosting natively.
   * Serverless, no infra to manage
2. A. AWS Fargate (wrong)
   * For containerized Apps, hosting static website is overkill
3. C. Amazon EC2 (wrong)
   * Requires provisioning and maintaining a web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.). You pay for compute 24/7, making it more expensive and less scalable.
4. D. ALB + Lambda (Express.js) (wrong)
   * Designed for dynamic APIs, not static sites. Complex and costly setup for something that S3 can handle easily.

## Reference
* CloudFront VS S3
* Q: If one of the option has cloudfront, should I choose cloudfront instead of S3?
* A: Choose just Amazon S3, not CloudFront, unless the question emphasizes:
  * Low latency performance
  * Global access
  * Content delivery speed
  * Security via signed URLs
  * Caching
  * Example: Users are accessing the website globally and need fast load times.
  * Example: The solution must reduce latency and bandwidth costs.
* The question focuses on cost-effectiveness and hosting a basic internal or public website with no specific performance/security needs. -> S3
