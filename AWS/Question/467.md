# Question 467
## Question
* A company uses AWS Organizations. A member account has purchased a Compute Savings Plan. Because of changes in the workloads inside the member account, the account no longer receives the full benefit of the Compute Savings Plan commitment. The company uses less than 50% of its purchased compute power.

## Options
* A. Turn on discount sharing from the Billing Preferences section of the account console in the member account that purchased the Compute Savings Plan.
* B. Turn on discount sharing from the Billing Preferences section of the account console in the company's Organizations management account.
* C. Migrate additional compute workloads from another AWS account to the account that has the Compute Savings Plan.
* D. Sell the excess Savings Plan commitment in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

## Answer
* B. Turn on discount sharing from the Billing Preferences section of the account console in the companyâ€™s Organizations management account.

## Explanation
1. A. Turn on discount sharing in the member account.
  * This option is incorrect because *discount sharing must be enabled in the management account of the AWS Organizations*, not in the member account that purchased the Compute Savings Plan.
2. D. Sell the excess Savings Plan commitment in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
  * This option is incorrect because *Savings Plans cannot be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace*. Only Reserved Instances can be sold there, and Savings Plans are not tradable.
3. C. Migrate additional compute workloads from another AWS account.
  * This option is valid but not the most operationally efficient solution. It requires additional effort to migrate workloads, which may not be feasible or necessary. 
4. B. Turn on discount sharing from the Billing Preferences section of the account console in the company's Organizations management account.
  * Compute Savings Plans apply at the organization level if discount sharing is enabled.
  * When discount sharing is turned on in the AWS Organizations management account, unused Savings Plan benefits can be shared with other member accounts.
  * This allows the company to maximize the utilization of the purchased Compute Savings Plan across all accounts in the organization.
