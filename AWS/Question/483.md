# Question 483
## Question
* A company containerized a *Windows job that runs on .NET 6 Framework under a Windows container*. The company wants to run this job in the AWS Cloud. The job *runs every 10 minutes*. The job’s *runtime varies between 1 minute and 3 minutes.*
* Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

## Options
* A.Create an *AWS Lambda* function based on the container image of the job. Configure *Amazon EventBridge* to invoke the function every 10 minutes.
* B.Use *AWS Batch* to create a job that uses *AWS Fargate resources*. Configure the job scheduling to run every 10 minutes.
* C.Use *Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate* to run the job. Create a scheduled task based on the container image of the job to run every 10 minutes.
* D.Use *Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate* to run the job. Create a standalone task based on the container image of the job. Use Windows task scheduler to run the job every 10 minutes.

## Answer
* A. Create an *AWS Lambda* function based on the container image of the job. Configure *Amazon EventBridge* to invoke the function every 10 minutes.

## Explanation
1. AWS Lambda + Amazon EventBridge
   * Lambda does not support Windows-based containers (Linux-based only)
2. AWS Batch + AWS Fargate
   * Batch can run scheduled jobs, but not support Windows containers on Fargate
   * Therefore, it requires EC2 to run Windows Jobs, which increasing cost and complexity.
3. ECS Standalone task + Windows Task Scheduler
   * It requires using Task Scheduler inside the container, which adds unncessary complexity and does not align with AWS-native scheduling best practices

## Thinking
* 那時候在想 Option B 還是 C 才是對的，因為Batch 的其中的其中的用途是用來執行重複性高的任務，但忽略了 Batch 不支援 Windows
