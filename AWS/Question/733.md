# Question 733
## Question
* An e-commerce company runs applications in AWS accounts that are part of an organization in AWS Organizations. The applications run on *Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL databases* across all the accounts. The company needs to *prevent malicious activity and must identify abnormal failed and incomplete login aempts to the databases*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?

## Options
* A. Attach service control policies (SCPs) to the root of the organization to identity the failed login attempts.
* B. Enable the Amazon RDS Protection feature in Amazon GuardDuty for the member accounts of the organization.
* C. Publish the Aurora general logs to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the log data to a central Amazon S3 bucket.
* D. Publish all the Aurora PostgreSQL database events in AWS CloudTrail to a central Amazon S3 bucket.

## Answer
* B. Enable the Amazon RDS Protection feature in Amazon GuardDuty for the member accounts of the organization.

## Explanation
* Asking the most operationally efficient way to identify abnormal failed and incomplete login attempts to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database across multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organizations setup
1. A. Service Control Policies (SCPs)
   * SCPs are used to set maximum permissions for accounts in an organization.
   * Do not provide monitoring or altering for specific database events like failed login attempts
   * Preventative actions, not detectino
2. **B. Amazon RDS Protection in Amazon GuardDuty**
   * Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. 
   * The Amazon RDS Protection feature specifically monitors and profiles login activity to Amazon Aurora databases (among others) to detect suspicious login attempts, brute-force attacks, and other potential threats.
   * GuardDuty is designed for operational efficiency as it is a managed service that automatically analyzes various data sources, including database login events, and generates findings. It can be enabled across an organization.
3. C. CloudWatch Logs (Aurora General logs) + S3 bucket
   * While this approach would collect the necessary log data (general logs often contain login attempts), it *requires significant operational overhead for analysis*
   * Users need to set up custom mechanisms to parse the logs
4. D. CloudTrail (Database events) + S3 bucket
   * AWS CloudTrail records API calls and events made in your AWS account. 
   * Does not capture individual database login attempts
