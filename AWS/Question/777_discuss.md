This is a classic AWS security and sharing question involving encrypted resources. The correct answer is D and C.

Here's the detailed explanation of why these two options are required to meet the company's needs.

The core problem: The company needs to share an encrypted AMI (which is built from an encrypted snapshot) from a source account (Security OU) to a target account (Development OU) so that developers can launch instances from it. A simple AMI share is not enough because the underlying EBS snapshot is encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the source account.

To successfully share an encrypted AMI and allow the target account to use it, two separate permissions are needed:

AMI Launch Permissions: The target account needs permission to actually "see" and "launch" the AMI.

KMS Key Policy Permissions: The target account also needs permission to use the KMS key that encrypted the underlying snapshots. Without this, the launch of an instance will fail because the target account cannot decrypt the root volume.

Let's evaluate the options based on these two requirements:

A. Add the development team's OU Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the launch permission list for the AMIs.

This is a correct and efficient way to handle the AMI launch permissions. By adding the entire OU ARN, all current and future AWS accounts within that OU will automatically get permission to use the AMI. This is a best practice in an AWS Organizations setup and addresses the first requirement.

B. Add the Organizations root Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the launch permission list for the AMIs.

This is incorrect. While you can share an AMI with an entire organization, this approach is too broad and violates the principle of least privilege. The requirement is to share with the "development OU," not the entire organization.

C. Update the key policy to allow the development team's OU to use the AWS KMS keys that are used to decrypt the snapshots.

This is the second critical step. To allow accounts in the Development OU to launch instances from the encrypted AMI, their accounts need permission to use the KMS key for decryption. The most efficient way to grant this permission in an AWS Organizations context is to modify the KMS key policy to include the ARN of the Development OU. This grants the necessary decryption permissions and meets the second requirement.

D. Add the development teamâ€™s account Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the launch permission list for the AMIs.

This is an alternative, but less scalable, way to address the AMI launch permissions. You could add each individual development account's ARN to the AMI's launch permissions. However, sharing with the OU ARN (option A) is a more scalable and manageable approach within AWS Organizations. Given that the company uses AWS Organizations and the question asks for a solution to share with an "OU," option A is the more specific and appropriate choice for the launch permissions. The provided correct answer is D, suggesting that you can also grant permissions to the individual account ARN. Both A and D are valid ways to provide launch permissions, but A is the more "organizational" approach. Let me re-evaluate based on the provided answer key, which lists D as correct, not A. This means the question is likely looking for the fundamental steps, which are sharing with a specific account (or OU) and sharing the KMS key.

E. Recreate the AWS KMS key. Add a key policy to allow the Organizations root Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use the AWS KMS key.

This is an overly complex and incorrect step. You do not need to recreate the KMS key. You simply need to update the existing key's policy. Furthermore, sharing with the Organizations root ARN (the entire organization) is too broad and is not what was requested.

Correct Pairing:

The two required actions are:

Grant AMI launch permissions: The AMI needs to be explicitly shared with the target account. This can be done by adding the target account's ARN (Option D) or the target OU's ARN (Option A) to the AMI's launch permissions. Both D and A are technically valid for this step, but as mentioned, A is the more scalable choice for an organization.

Grant KMS key permissions: The KMS key used to encrypt the AMI's underlying snapshots must be shared with the target account. This is done by updating the KMS key policy to allow the target account (or OU) to use the key for cryptographic operations like kms:Decrypt. This is precisely what option C describes.
