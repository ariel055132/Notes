# Question 371

## Question
* A company needs to create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(Amazon EKS) cluster to host a digital media streaming application. The EKS cluster will use a managed node group that is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for storage. The company must *encrypt all data at rest by using a customer managed key* that is stored in *AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)*.
* Which combination of actions will meet this requirement with the *LEAST operational overhead?* (Choose two.)

## Options
* A.Use a Kubernetes plugin that uses the customer managed key to perform data encryption.
* B.After creation of the EKS cluster, locate the EBS volumes. Enable encryption by using the customer managed key.
* C.Enable EBS encryption by default in the AWS Region where the EKS cluster will be created. Select the customer managed key as the default key.
* D.Create the EKS cluster. Create an IAM role that has a policy that grants permission to the customer managed key. Associate the role with the EKS cluster.
* E.Store the customer managed key as a Kubernetes secret in the EKS cluster. Use the customer managed key to encrypt the EBS volumes

## Answer
* C. Enable EBS encryption by default in the AWS Region where the EKS cluster will be created. Select the customer managed key as the default key.
* D. Create the EKS cluster. Create an IAM role that has a policy that grants permission to the customer managed key. Associate the role with the EKS cluster.

## Explanation
* Enabling EBS encryption by default in the AWS Region where the EKS cluster will be created ensures that all EBS volumes created for the managed node group are automatically encrypted using the specified customer managed key. This approach minimizes operational overhead as it applies to all future EBS volumes without requiring additional configuration.
* Creating an IAM role with a policy that grants permission to the customer managed key and associating it with the EKS cluster allows the EKS cluster to use the customer managed key for encryption. This setup ensures that the EKS cluster can access the key without requiring manual intervention for each volume.
* Option A is incorrect because using a Kubernetes plugin for encryption would introduce additional complexity and operational overhead, as it would require managing the plugin and ensuring it works correctly with the EKS cluster.
* Option B is incorrect because enabling encryption on existing EBS volumes after the EKS cluster is created does not meet the requirement for encrypting all data at rest from the outset and would require manual intervention for each volume.
* Option E is incorrect because storing the customer managed key as a Kubernetes secret does not provide the necessary integration with EBS encryption. EBS volumes require direct access to the KMS key through IAM roles, not through Kubernetes secrets.
