# Question 564
## Question
* A company is building an ecommerce application and needs to store sensitive customer information. The company needs to *give customers the ability to complete purchase transactions on the website*. The company also needs to *ensure that sensitive customer data is protected, even from database administrators*.
* Which solution meets these requirements?

## Options
* A.Store sensitive data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Use EBS encryption to encrypt the data. Use an IAM instance role to restrict access.
* B.Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data.
* C.Store sensitive data in Amazon S3. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) server-side encryption to encrypt the data. Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access.
* D.Store sensitive data in Amazon FSx for Windows Server. Mount the file share on application servers. Use Windows file permissions to restrict access

## Answer 
* B.Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data.


## Explanation
1. A. EBS + IAM instance role
   * EBS volumes can be encrypted, but this is block-level encryption.
   * It does not prevent access by the OS or database users like DBAs.
   * Not suitable for structured database-like access patterns.
2. C. S3 + Server-side encryption
   * Server-side encryption with KMS on S3 is good for object storage but not ideal for transactional, relational data. (S3 本來就是 Object Storage，與題目所需要使用的 Transctional, Relational 資料比較難)
   * Does not meet the need for a relational database or for processing purchase transactions in real time.
3. D. FSx for Windows Server + Windows File Permissions
   * File-level permissions are not sufficient to protect sensitive data from administrators.
   * FSx is not a relational database and is not suitable for ecommerce applications requiring transactional capabilities.
   * 如果題目是說資料要從Local段，使用Windows系統遷移到AWS，然後也要保持Local段使用，那用 FSx for windows server 就比較適合
4. B. RDS for MySQL + KMS client encryption
   * Using Amazon RDS for MySQL allows the company to run a scalable, managed relational database to support ecommerce transactions.

## Thinking
* 基本上就是 Option B 和 Option C 在選，因為只有這兩者有提到使用 AWS KMS 來進行加密 & key 的管理
* 只是 Option B 更好，因為 client-side 的加密可以確保資料在進入資料庫的時候已經加密了，代表 DBA 無法觀看原來的 plaintext data

## More
* but client-side encryption means that the plaintext data is encrypted by user, doesn't it means dba can view the plaintext data by encrypted the text
* What is Client-Side Encryption?
  1. Encrypted on the client (e.g., the application server) before it is sent to AWS services like Amazon RDS or S3.
  2. The AWS service (like RDS) only sees ciphertext.
  3. The encryption keys are never stored or managed by AWS, unless you’re using a hybrid model.
* Key Strategy is important.
