The correct solution is B. Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the best solution and why the others are less effective or incorrect:

A. Mount the EFS file system in read-only mode from within the EC2 instances.

This is a client-side solution. It relies on the configuration of the EC2 instances themselves. While it might work for a well-managed setup, it's not a strong security control. An administrator or a misconfigured application could easily remount the file system in read-write mode. The company wants a solution that uses IAM access control, which is a server-side, centralized, and more robust way to enforce permissions.

B. Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.

This is the ideal solution because it uses a resource-based policy directly on the EFS file system. A resource policy (also known as a file system policy in EFS) specifies who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it.

By explicitly denying the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action for the IAM roles of the EC2 instances, you are creating a "deny-by-default" rule that cannot be overridden by the client-side mount options. This is a robust and secure way to enforce the read-only requirement. It aligns with the principle of least privilege and uses AWS's native IAM access control mechanisms to their full potential.

C. Create an identity policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action on the EFS file system.

This option is incorrectly phrased. An "identity policy" (like a policy attached to an IAM role) can grant or deny permissions, but it's not a policy for the EFS file system. It's a policy for the IAM role. The most robust way to enforce a rule like this is with a resource policy directly on the EFS file system itself, which can override permissions granted in an identity policy. While you could create an identity policy that only grants ClientRead permissions, a resource-based policy that explicitly denies ClientWrite is a stronger security control.

D. Create an EFS access point for each application. Use Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) file permissions to allow read-only access to files in the root directory.

EFS access points are a powerful feature for managing application-level access to specific directories within an EFS file system. They are often used to enforce a specific user ID and group ID (POSIX permissions). While POSIX permissions can be used for read-only access, this solution has a few drawbacks for this specific scenario:

It relies on the correct configuration of POSIX permissions, which can be complex to manage at scale.

The company is asking to use IAM access control, and while access points can work with IAM, the most direct and effective way to deny a specific IAM action (ClientWrite) is with a resource policy as described in option B.

Option B provides a more direct and centralized control plane for this requirement than managing POSIX permissions across multiple access points.
