# Question 369
## Question
* A company has migrated an application to Amazon EC2 Linux instances. One of these EC2 instances runs several 1-hour tasks on a schedule. These tasks were written by different teams and have no common programming language. The company is concerned about performance and scalability while these tasks run on a single instance.

## Options
* A.Use AWS Batch to run the tasks as jobs. Schedule the jobs by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
* B.Convert the EC2 instance to a container. Use AWS App Runner to create the container on demand to run the tasks as jobs.
* C.Copy the tasks into AWS Lambda functions. Schedule the Lambda functions by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
* D.Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the EC2 instance that runs the tasks. Create an Auto Scaling group with the AMI to run multiple copies of the instance.

## Answer
* A. Use AWS Batch to run the tasks as jobs. Schedule the jobs by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

## Explanation
* AWS Batch is designed to efficiently run batch computing workloads, allowing you to run jobs in parallel across multiple instances. It can handle tasks written in different programming languages and provides built-in scheduling capabilities through Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). This solution allows for better performance and scalability by distributing the workload across multiple instances as needed.
* Option B is incorrect because AWS App Runner is primarily used for running web applications and APIs, not for running scheduled batch jobs.
* Option C is incorrect because while AWS Lambda can run tasks in parallel, it has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, which is not suitable for the 1-hour tasks described. Additionally, converting existing tasks to Lambda functions may require significant code changes.
* Option D is incorrect because creating an Auto Scaling group with a single AMI does not provide the scalability and performance benefits of AWS Batch. It would also not address the issue of running tasks written in different programming languages efficiently.
