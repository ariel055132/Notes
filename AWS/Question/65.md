* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST operational overhead*?

## Option
* A. Use existing Python libraries to extract the text from the reports and to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
* B. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
* C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
* D. Use Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.

## Answer 
* C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
* (Option A): 自建 python 程式識別...看起來就 Operational overhead 
* (Option B): SageMaker 還是需要 User 自己建立相關模型，Operational overhead
* (Option D): Amazon Rekognition 是用來識別圖片中的資料，無法識別 PDF 中的內容
