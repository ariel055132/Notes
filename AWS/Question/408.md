# Question 408
## Question
* A company runs an application that receives data from thousands of geographically dispersed remote devices that use *UDP*. The application processes the data immediately and sends a message back to the device if necessary. No data is stored. The company needs a solution that *minimizes latency for the data transmission from the devices*. The solution also must provide rapid failover to another AWS Region.

* Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Option
A.Configure an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in each of the two Regions. Configure the NLB to invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the data.

B.Use AWS Global Accelerator. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in each of the two Regions as an endpoint. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the Fargate launch type. Create an ECS service on the cluster. Set the ECS service as the target for the NLB. Process the data in Amazon ECS.

C.Use AWS Global Accelerator. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in each of the two Regions as an endpoint. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the Fargate launch type. Create an ECS service on the cluster. Set the ECS service as the target for the ALB. Process the data in Amazon ECS.

D.Configure an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in each of the two Regions. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the Fargate launch type. Create an ECS service on the cluster. Set the ECS service as the target for the ALB. Process the data in Amazon ECS.

## Answer
* ✅ B. Use AWS Global Accelerator. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in each of the two Regions as an endpoint. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the Fargate launch type. Create an ECS service on the cluster. Set the ECS service as the target for the NLB. Process the data in Amazon ECS.

## Explanation
* ✔️ Why Option B is correct:
  * UDP Support: Only Network Load Balancers (NLBs) support the UDP protocol, which is crucial for this use case.
  * AWS Global Accelerator: Improves latency and performance for global users by directing traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint automatically.
  * Multi-Region Failover: Global Accelerator allows automatic failover across Regions.
  * Fargate on ECS: Serverless container compute engine to scale automatically, reducing operational overhead.
* ✔️ Why other options are incorrect:
  * Option A: Lambda does not support UDP
  * Option C: Uses Application Load Balancer (ALB), which does not support UDP. This makes it unsuitable for the requirements.
  * Option D: Similar to Option C, it uses ALB, which does not support UDP. Also Route 53 failover routing is slower than Global Accelerator.
* 看到 UDP，基本可以排除 Option C，D。因為 NLB 只支援 HTTP 和 HTTPS。並不支援 UDP。
