# Question 715
## Question
* A company uses Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda to run multiple workloads in the company's AWS account. The company wants to fully make use of its Compute Savings Plans. The company wants to *receive notication when coverage of the Compute Savings Plans drops*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *MOST operational efficiency*?

## Option
* A. Create a daily budget for the Savings Plans by using AWS Budgets. Congure the budget with a coverage threshold to send notications to the appropriate email message recipients. 
* B. Create a Lambda function that runs a coverage report against the Savings Plans. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to email the report to the appropriate email message recipients.
* C. Create an AWS Budgets report for the Savings Plans budget. Set the frequency to daily.
* D. Create a Savings Plans alert subscription. Enable all notication options. Enter an email address to receive notications.

## Answer
* A. Create a daily budget for the Savings Plans by using AWS Budgets. Congure the budget with a coverage threshold to send notications to the appropriate email message recipients. 

## Explanation
* Users need the most operationally efficient solution for receiving notifications when Compute Savings Plans coverage drops:
1. A. AWS Budgets & Coverage Threshold + Send Notification
   * AWS Budgets is a fully managed service specifically designed for cost and usage management, including Savings Plans coverage.
   * It allows you to set up custom budgets with thresholds for various metrics, including coverage. When a threshold is breached, AWS Budgets automatically sends notifications via SNS topics (which can then send emails, SMS, etc.).
   * highly automated and low-maintenance solution.
2. B. Lambda + Amazon EFS
   * Lambda involves creating and maintaining custom code (Lambda function).
   * less operationally efficient.
3. C. AWS Budgets Report 
   * AWS Budgets reports are good for viewing historical and current usage/cost data.
   * While you can set a daily frequency, a report itself doesn't inherently send notifications when a threshold is crossed. You would still need to manually review the report or configure a budget with notifications (as in option A) for proactive alerting.
4. D. Savings Plan alert subscription + notification
   * AWS provides some basic Savings Plans alerts directly, but they are generally less granular or customizable than what AWS Budgets offers for coverage specifically.


## Thinking
* 看到 MOST operational efficiency，基本上先排除 Option B，因為 Option B 需要 User 自行寫邏輯去進行相關事情 Trigger，以及獲取什麼內容
* 然後 Option C 基本上只是提供資料，並沒有對發送通知作琢磨，也可以先排除
* 所以基本上只剩下 Option A 和 D 在選
* 然後 Option D 沒有 Option A 好的原因：Savings Plan alert subscription 的顆粒度沒有 Option A 來得密
