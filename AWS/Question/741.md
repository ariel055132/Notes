# Question 741
## Question
* The DNS provider that hosts a company's domain name records is experiencing outages that cause service disruption for a website running on AWS. The company needs to migrate to a more resilient managed DNS service and wants the service to run on AWS.
* What should a solutions architect do to rapidly migrate the DNS hosting service?

## Option
* A. Create an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone for the domain name. Import the zone file containing the domain records hosted by the previous provider.
* B. Create an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for the domain name. Import the zone file containing the domain records hosted by the previous provider.
* C. Create a Simple AD directory in AWS. Enable zone transfer between the DNS provider and AWS Directory Service for MicrosoftÂ Active Directory for the domain records.
* D. Create an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint in the VPC. Specify the IP addresses that the provider's DNS will forward DNS queries to. Configure the provider's DNS to forward DNS queries for the domain to the IP addresses that are specied in the inbound endpoint.

## Answer
* A. Create an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone for the domain name. Import the zone file containing the domain records hosted by the previous provider.

## Explanation
* rapidly migrate a company's domain name records from an unreliable DNS provider to a more resilient managed DNS service running on AWS, specifically for a public website.
1. **A. Amazon Route53 public hosted zone**
   * Amazon Route 53 is AWS's highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service, which is exactly what the company needs for resilience.
   * A public hosted zone is used for managing DNS records for internet-facing resources (like a website).
   * Route 53 supports *importing existing zone files*, which allows for a rapid migration of all existing DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) from the old provider.
   * After importing, the final step would be to *update the name servers at the domain registrar to point to the Route 53 name servers*. This is a standard and efficient migration process. This option aligns perfectly with the requirements.
2. B. Amazon Route53 private hosted zone
   * A private hosted zone in Route 53 is used for DNS resolution within a VPC, not for public internet-facing resources.
   * Since the website is experiencing service disruption due to public DNS outages, a private hosted zone is not appropriate for migrating the public-facing DNS.
3. C. Simple AD 
   * Simple AD is a managed directory service, primarily for managing users, groups, and computers within an AWS environment, often for internal applications. It includes a DNS server, but it's not designed as a primary public DNS hosting service for a website.
4. D. Amazon Route 53 Resolver
   * Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints are used to allow on-premises DNS resolvers to query DNS records for resources within your VPC. This is part of hybrid DNS solutions.
   * This option implies keeping the current problematic DNS provider and merely forwarding queries to AWS. The goal is to migrate away from the unreliable provider entirely, not to forward queries from it. This solution does not address the core problem of the current provider's unreliability.

* Inbound: Local -> VPC
* Outbound: VPC -> Local
