# Question 43
## Question
* A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about *internet bandwidth limitations*. 
* A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both *timely backups to Amazon S3* and with *minimal impact on internet connectivity* for internal users.
* Which solution meets these requirements?

## Option
* A. Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
* B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
* C. Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day.
* D. Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.


## Answer
* B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.


## Explanation
* AWS Direct Connect establishes a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public internet entirely, providing a stable, high-bandwidth, and low-latency link.
* By routing backup traffic through this new connection, the on-premises application can transfer data to Amazon S3 without competing for bandwidth with internal users' internet activity. 
* It's a scalable and reliable way to handle large, time-sensitive data transfers.

1. A. Establish *AWS VPN connections* and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
   * A VPN connection still relies on the public internet. While it provides a secure tunnel, it doesn't solve the underlying problem of limited internet bandwidth. The backup traffic would still compete with internal users for the same internet connection, leading to the same performance issues.

## Thinking
* 基本上不會選 Option C，Option D
* Option C 的 Snowball devices，主要是用來進行超大量的資料轉移
* Option D 的解除 service limits 不太可能，因為這個是用來限制 User 過分存取 S3 的措施，但問題是這無法解決問題
