# Question 674
## Question
* A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses a database that runs on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The application *performs slowly when traffic increases*. The *database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic*.
* Which actions should a solutions architect take to resolve these performance issues? (Choose two.)

## Option
* A.Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance.
* B.Create a read replica for the DB instance. Configure the application to send read traffic to the read replica.
* C.Convert the DB instance to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Configure the application to send read traffic to the standby DB instance.
* D.Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Configure the application to cache query results in the ElastiCache cluster.
* E.Configure the Auto Scaling group subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances are provisioned in the same Availability Zone as the DB instance

## Answer
* B. Create a read replica for the DB instance
* D. Use Amazon ElastiCache

## Explanation
1. A. Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance (wrong)
   * RDS does not support traditional auto scaling like EC2.
   * You can use *storage auto-scaling*, but not CPU or instance size auto scaling.
   * You must manually or programmatically scale the instance type.
2. C. Convert to Multi-AZ DB (wrong)
   * *Multi-AZ provides high availability and failover*, not performance scaling.
   * The standby instance cannot be used for reads — it’s for disaster recovery only.
3. E. Auto Scaling group in same AZ (wrong)
   * While *AZ proximity can reduce network latency*, it’s not a solution for database read load issues.
   * Minor performance gain, but doesn’t address the root cause (DB saturation).
4. B. Create a read replica for the DB instance
   * Read replicas are designed to handle read-heavy workloads.
   * configure your application to direct read queries to the replica.
   * Helps reduce load on the primary DB (which handles both reads and writes).
5. D. Use Amazon ElastiCache
   * ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached) is used to cache frequently accessed data.
   * Reduces repetitive queries to the database.
   * Greatly improves application responsiveness and reduces DB load.

## Thinking
* 題目指出 DB 運行慢的原因是 DB 資源被塞滿了，資源不夠處理其他需求，Performance 需要提升，所以就是先看其他 Options 的結果是不是可以提升 Performance 
* 基本上常見的是：Read Replica （建立一個專門用作進行查詢的 DB 複製體，讓所有查詢的Request 都直接查 read replica，這樣子減低主 database 的 workload) / 提供 Cache (暫存)
* 所以 Option B 會選 (Option D 也有比較大的機率會選)
* 剩下就是 Option A, C, D, E
* Option C 的選項與提升 DB performance 不符，排除
* Option A 這個選項的內容其實看不太懂，到底 Auto Scaling DB instance 是提升哪種 instance 的 performance? (Storage? CPU performance?這邊 ChatGPT 有提出是 Storage，所以其實也不太符合題目需求)
* Option E 則是 查了才知道是降低 network latency
* 因此只剩 Option D
