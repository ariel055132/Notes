# Question 685
## Question
* A company’s ecommerce website has *unpredictable traffic and uses AWS Lambda functions to directly access a private Amazon RD*S for PostgreSQL DB instance. The company wants to *maintain predictable database performance and ensure that the Lambda invocations do not overload the database with too many connections*.
* What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

## Option
* A.Point the client driver at an RDS custom endpoint. Deploy the Lambda functions inside a VPC.
* B.Point the client driver at an RDS proxy endpoint. Deploy the Lambda functions inside a VPC.
* C.Point the client driver at an RDS custom endpoint. Deploy the Lambda functions outside a VPC.
* D.Point the client driver at an RDS proxy endpoint. Deploy the Lambda functions outside a VPC.

## Answer 
* B.Point the client driver at an RDS proxy endpoint. Deploy the Lambda functions inside a VPC.

## Explanation
* Problem
  * Lambda functions can scale rapidly and may create too many concurrent connections to the Amazon RDS database, which can overload it and cause performance issues.
* Solution
  * Use Amazon RDS Proxy, which:
    * Manages a connection pool between your Lambda functions and the database.
    * Reuses and limits DB connections to avoid overwhelming the database.
    * Improves scalability and predictable performance.
* Incorrect Options
  1. A. Custom endpoint + VPC
    * Does not solve the connection overload issue — no proxy is used.
  2. C. Custom endpoint + outside VPC
    * Cannot access a private RDS instance without a VPC connection.
  3. D. Proxy endpoint + outside VPC
    * RDS Proxy is VPC-based — Lambda must be in the same VPC.


## Thinking
* Option 基本上顯示 Option A, C; Option B, D 之間選一個
* 基本上看到要控制 Connection 的數量，基本上使用 Proxy，因此先排除 A，C，只剩下 B，D
* 然後是判斷到底是 inside VPC, outside VPC，基本上都要 inside VPC
