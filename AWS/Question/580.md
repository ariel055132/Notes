# Question 580
## Question
* A company uses locally attached storage to run a latency-sensitive application on premises. The company is using a lift and shift method to move the application to the AWS Cloud. The company does not want to change the application architecture.
* Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

## Options
* A. Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to run the application.
* B. Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP2 volume to run the application.
* C. Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system to run the application.
* D. Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP3 volume to run the application.

## Explanation
1. A. EC2 instance + FSx for Lustre
   * FSx for Lustre is optimized for high-throughput, HPC workloads, not general purpose / latency-sensitive apps
   * Requires changing the application to use shared file system APIs.
2. B. EBS GP2
   * Valid, but GP3 is strictly better — cheaper and more tunable performance.
   * GP3 should be the default choice over GP2 unless there’s legacy constraint.
3. C. FSx for OpenZFS
   * Also a shared file system, not block storage — not equivalent to local disk.

## Thinking
* Lift and shift method
  * aka. rehosting
  * move an existing application to the cloud without making significant changes to its architecture or code
* 忘記了 FSx 這種是 hybrid deployment (local + cloud)，需要用 EFS (Elastic File System) / Shared file system，進行遷移時要轉 File System ...
* Option C 這個太冷門了吧.. 先不選
