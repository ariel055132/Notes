# Question 457
## Question
* A company that uses AWS is building an application to transfer data to a product manufacturer. The company has its own identity provider (IdP). The company wants the IdP to authenticate application users while the users use the application to transfer data. The company must use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) protocol.
* Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Options
A.Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.
B.Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task for IdP authentication.
C.Use AWS Transfer Family to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.
D.Use AWS Storage Gateway to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool for IdP authentication.

## Answer
C. Use AWS Transfer Family to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.

## Explanation
1. A. AWS DataSync to transfer data, AWS Lambda for IdP authentication
   * AWS DataSync is primarily for *data transfer between cloud (NFS, SMB, S3) and on-premises systems*, not specifically for AS2 protocol.
2. B. Amazon AppFlow + ECS
   * Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that can transfer data between AWS services and SaaS applications. However, it does not natively support AS2 protocol.
   * Amazon ECS can run containerized applications, but it would require additional setup to handle AS2 protocol and IdP authentication.
3. D. AWS Storage Gateway + Amazon Cognito
   * AWS Storage Gateway is for *hybrid cloud storage solutions* and does not natively support AS2 protocol.
   * Amazon Cognito is primarily for user authentication and does not directly handle AS2 data transfers.
