# Question 764
## Question
* A company wants to migrate its three-tier application from on premises to AWS. The web tier and the application tier are running on third-party virtual machines (VMs). The database tier is running on MySQL.
* The company needs to migrate the application by making the fewest possible changes to the architecture. The company also needs a database solution that can restore data to a specific point in time.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

## Options
* A. Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.
* B. Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in private subnets.
* C.Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets
* D.Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in public subnets

## Answer
* B. Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in private subnets.


## Explanation
* Situation
  * migrate a three-tier application to AWS with the *fewest possible changes to the architecture* and the *least operational overhead*. 
  * The database is MySQL and requires *point-in-time restore*
1. A. Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.
   * *Private Subnets*: **Placing both application tiers and the database in private subnets is a standard and recommended security practice**, reducing exposure to the public internet. Access to the web tier would typically be through a public-facing load balancer.
2. B. Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in private subnets.
   * *Public vs. Private Subnets*: **Placing the web tier in public subnets is common**, but often the public access is controlled by a load balancer, and the instances themselves could still be in private subnets with traffic routed via the load balancer.
   * *Aurora vs. RDS*: **Both offer point-in-time restore and are fully managed**. Aurora often provides more advanced features and slightly less operational overhead (e.g., storage scaling, fault tolerance) for databases.
3. C. Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.
   * *Good security exposure*: Web Tier placed in public subnet, Application tier placer in private subnet
4. D. Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in public subnets.
   * *Public Subnets for all tiers*: Placing the application tier and especially the database tier in public subnets is a significant security risk and is generally **not recommended** 
   * *Aurora MySQL*: Good for the database part (managed, point-in-time restore).

* The most robust and operationally efficient solution, while adhering to security best practices (private subnets for app/db), is C. It balances the need for minimal architectural changes (lift-and-shift VMs to EC2, use managed MySQL), least operational overhead (RDS manages the database), and a crucial feature (point-in-time restore).
* Option B with Aurora also meets the criteria very well, perhaps even less operational overhead for the database, but RDS for MySQL is "closer" to the original MySQL.
* However, the question also emphasizes "least operational overhead" overall. **Aurora's advanced management capabilities (auto-scaling storage, high durability, fast failovers) generally lead to lower operational overhead for the database tier compared to standard RDS, even if both are "managed."**

## Thinking
* 基本上不要將所有東西放到 public network，通常將 web tier 放到 public network，然後將 application tier / 其他東西放到 private network，安全性將提高
* 然後看到 mySQL / PostgreSQL 這些字眼，選 Aurora 吧..
