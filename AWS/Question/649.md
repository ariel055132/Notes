# Question 649
## Question
* An ecommerce company runs a PostgreSQL database on premises. The database stores data by using high IOPS Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage. The daily peak I/O transactions per second do not exceed 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and provision disk IOPS performance independent of disk storage capacity.
* Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

## Options
* A.Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
* B.Configure the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
* C.Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
* D.Configure the EBS magnetic volume type to achieve maximum IOPS.

## Answers
* C.Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.

## Explanation
1. A. GP2
   * IOPS scales with volume size, and you cannot provision IOPS separately.
   * To get 15,000 IOPS, you’d need ~5 TB of gp2 storage (since gp2 gives 3 IOPS per GB).
   * Not cost-effective — you’re paying for storage you don’t need.
2. B. io1
   * Supports 15,000 IOPS and separate IOPS configuration.
   * Much more expensive than gp3.
   * Better for critical latency-sensitive workloads where ultra-high durability is needed (not cost-effective in this case).
3. D. Magnetic
   * Outdated and deprecated for most RDS setups.
   * Max IOPS is much lower than 15,000.
   * Doesn’t meet performance needs.


## Thinking
* 只能背了吧 = ="
* 稍微記一下 io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD) 這種專門處理對 latency 很敏感的情況
