# Question 821
## Question
* A company uses Salesforce. The company needs to *load existing data and ongoing data changes from Salesforce to Amazon Redshift* for analysis. The company *does not want the data to travel over the public internet*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST development effort*?

## Options
* A. Establish a VPN connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
* B. Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
* C. Create an AWS PrivateLink connection in the VPC to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.
* D. Create a VPC peering connection to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data

## Answer
* C. Create an AWS PrivateLink connection in the VPC to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.


## Explanation
* *Amazon AppFlow*: This is a fully managed integration service specifically designed to securely transfer data between SaaS applications like Salesforce and AWS services like Amazon Redshift.
* *AWS PrivateLink*: This is the key component for ensuring data does not travel over the public internet. AWS PrivateLink allows you to create a private endpoint in your VPC that connects directly to supported AWS and partner services (including Salesforce, via Salesforce Private Connect).

* Why not correct
1. A. Establish a *VPN connection* from the VPC to Salesforce. Use *AWS Glue DataBrew* to transfer data.
   * While VPN can provide a private connection, it requires significant setup and management effort compared to AWS privateLink (not fulfill LEAST developement effort)
   * AWS Glue DataBrew is a data preparation service, not a data transfer service. While you can use it to clean and transform data, it's not the primary tool for moving data from a source like Salesforce to a destination like Redshift. 
2. B. Establish an *AWS Direct Connect* connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use *AWS Glue DataBrew* to transfer data.
   * AWS Direct Connect is used to establish a private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS, not directly from an AWS VPC to a SaaS provider like Salesforce.
3. D. Create a *VPC peering connection* to Salesforce. Use *Amazon AppFlow* to transfer data.
   * VPC peering is used to connect two AWS VPCs together. Salesfore's network is not an VPC that can simply peer with

## Thinking
* 那時候是 Option C, D 在 Check
* 為什麼不選 Option A 
  * Option A 一開始有提到建立 VPN Connection
  * 直接建立從 VPC 到 Salesforce 的 VPN Connection 在建立時就已經要花一定的作業能力，而且建立完後，也需要花費額外的時間進行管理，與題目的 LEAST development effort 不符合
* 為什麼不選 Option B
  * 其實 Direct Connection 比建立 VPN Connection 也很麻煩

## Reference
* 額外問：Amazon Appflow is used for transfer data between SaaS application and AWS service, while Amazon DataSync is used for migrate / transfer data between local / on-premises server to AWS Cloud server. Is it correct
* *Amazon AppFlow*
  * Connects and transfers data between **SaaS applications** (Software-as-a-Service) and **AWS services**
* *Amazon DataSync*
  * High-performance, large-scale data transfer between **on-premises storage systems** and **AWS storage services**

* AWS Direct Connect vs Amazon PrivateLink vs VPC Peering
  * AWS Direct Connect
    * Establish a private network connection from *on-premises data center* to *AWS*
  * Amazon PrivateLink
    * Create a private endpoint in *VPC* that connects directly to supported *AWS and partner service*
  * VPC Peering
    * *Connect two AWS VPCs* together

* AWS DataBrew
  * Data Preparation Service
  * clean and transform the data for further process
