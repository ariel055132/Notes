# Question 821
## Question
* A company uses Salesforce. The company needs to load existing data and ongoing data changes from Salesforce to Amazon Redshift for analysis. The company does not want the data to travel over the public internet.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the *LEAST development effort*?

## Options
* A. Establish a VPN connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
* B. Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
* C. Create an AWS PrivateLink connection in the VPC to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.
* D. Create a VPC peering connection to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data

## Answer
* C. Create an AWS PrivateLink connection in the VPC to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.


## Explanation
* *Amazon AppFlow*: This is a fully managed integration service specifically designed to securely transfer data between SaaS applications like Salesforce and AWS services like Amazon Redshift.
* *AWS PrivateLink*: This is the key component for ensuring data does not travel over the public internet. AWS PrivateLink allows you to create a private endpoint in your VPC that connects directly to supported AWS and partner services (including Salesforce, via Salesforce Private Connect).

* Why not correct
1. A. Establish a *VPN connection* from the VPC to Salesforce. Use *AWS Glue DataBrew* to transfer data.
   * While VPN can provide a private connection, it requires significant setup and management effort compared to AWS privateLink (not fulfill LEAST developement effort)
   * AWS Glue DataBrew is a data preparation service, not a data transfer service. While you can use it to clean and transform data, it's not the primary tool for moving data from a source like Salesforce to a destination like Redshift. 
2. B. Establish an *AWS Direct Connect* connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use *AWS Glue DataBrew* to transfer data.
   * AWS Direct Connect is used to establish a private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS, not directly from an AWS VPC to a SaaS provider like Salesforce.
3. D. Create a *VPC peering connection* to Salesforce. Use *Amazon AppFlow* to transfer data.
   * VPC peering is used to connect two AWS VPCs together. Salesfore's network is not an VPC that can simply peer with
