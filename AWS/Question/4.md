# Question 4
## Question
* An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
* Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

## Option
* A.Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.
* B.Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.
* C.Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access
* D.Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.

## Answer
* A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.

## Explanation
* A Gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 enables private connectivity from your VPC to S3 without using the public internet or a NAT gateway.
* It uses the AWS private network and does not require internet access, making it secure and cost-efficient.
* Once the gateway endpoint is created and associated with appropriate route tables and IAM policies, the EC2 instance can access the S3 bucket entirely over private IPs.

## Thinking
* VPC Endpoint 主要是用於處理私人的網路連接到 AWS 服務的需求，特別是當 EC2 實例需要存取 S3 或 DynamoDB 等服務時。分為兩種：
  1. Gateway Endpoint: 用於 S3 和 DynamoDB
  2. Interface Endpoint: 用於其他 AWS 服務
