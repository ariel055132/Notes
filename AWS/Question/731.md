# Question 731
## Question
* A company has an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table for storage. A solutions architect discovers that *many requests to the table are not returning the latest data*. The company's users have *not reported any other issues with database performance*. Latency is in an acceptable range.
* Which design change should the solutions architect recommend?

## Option
* A. Add read replicas to the table.
* B. Use a global secondary index (GSI).
* C. Request strongly consistent reads for the table.
* D. Request eventually consistent reads for the table.

## Answer
* C. Request strongly consistent reads for the table.


## Explanation
1. A. *Read Replicas*
   * DynamoDB does not have "read replicas" in the same way that relational databases like Amazon RDS do
2. B. *Global secondary index (GSI)*
   * It is used to query data using attributes other than the primary key. 
   * Would not solve the problem of not returning the latest data from the main table
3. **C. Request strongly consistent reads for the table.** 
   * When you request a strongly consistent read, DynamoDB ensures that you always receive the most up-to-date data, reflecting all prior write operations that were successful. There is no possibility of reading stale data.
4. D. Request *eventually consistent reads* for the table.
   * The default reading methods, offer the best read performance.
   * But it may not reflect the results of a recently completed write
