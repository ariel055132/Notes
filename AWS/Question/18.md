# Question 18
## Question 
* An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. 
* When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
* A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
* Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

## Option
* A.Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
* B.Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
* C.Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
* D.Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
* E.Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing

## Answer
* A + B

## Explanation
1. C. Lambda monitors S3 and writes to in-memory text file (incorrect)
   * In-memory state is lost on Lambda cold starts or retries — not durable.
   * Poor design for tracking processing — doesn’t persist state across executions
2. D. EC2 instance monitors SQS and invokes Lambda
   * Adds unnecessary infrastructure and complexity.
   * EC2 is not stateless, incurs ongoing cost, and defeats serverless benefits.
3. E. EventBridge → SNS for email alerts
   * Sending email notifications doesn’t meet the processing requirement.
   * SNS and EventBridge are better for notifications and orchestration, not direct image processing.

4. A sets up the notification from S3 to SQS when a user uploads a file.
5. B allows the Lambda function to be triggered asynchronously by new SQS messages.


## Thinking
* Option E 就同題目無關，因此可以先排除
