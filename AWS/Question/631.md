# Question 631
## Question
* A social media company wants to *store its database of user profiles, relationships, and interactions in the AWS Cloud*. The company needs an application to *monitor any changes in the database*. The application needs to *analyze the relationships between the data entities and to provide recommendations to users*.
* Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?


## Option
* A.Use Amazon Neptune to store the information. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to process changes in the database.
* B.Use Amazon Neptune to store the information. Use Neptune Streams to process changes in the database.
* C.Use Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) to store the information. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to process changes in the database.
* D.Use Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) to store the information. Use Neptune Streams to process changes in the database.

## Answer
* B.Use Amazon Neptune to store the information. Use Neptune Streams to process changes in the database.

## Explanation
* Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service that supports property graph (Gremlin) and RDF (SPARQL) models — making it ideal for:
  1. Storing and querying relationships (e.g., user connections in social networks)
  2. Analyzing interactions (likes, follows, comments, etc.)
  3. Generating recommendations based on graph traversal

* Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) is a fully managed ledger database designed to provide a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log. It’s ideal for use cases where it’s critical to track all changes to data over time, such as in financial, supply chain, or compliance systems.

1. A. Amazon Neptune + Amazon Kinesis Data Stream
   * While you could manually capture and stream changes using external services, Neptune Streams is built-in and requires less operational overhead than setting up Kinesis separately.
2. C. Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) + Kinesis Data Streams
   * QLDB is optimized for immutable, verifiable transaction logs, not for querying or traversing complex relationships — which are key to social media use cases.
3. D. QLDB + Neptune Streams
   * Invalid combo: Neptune Streams are for Neptune only, not compatible with QLDB.
