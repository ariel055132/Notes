EC2 enable you to run virtual servers in the cloud.

- What is EC2
- How to deploy them
- How to configure them
- make sure they have the right storage systems attached, the right IP address, they can communicate on the network
- Pricing models

=== 

* EC2 instances are virtual servers running in AWS data centers
1. Run Windows / Linux / MacOs on dedicated hardware
2. Connect to network via Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
launched in public / private subnets in VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
3. Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes are attached to EC2 instances for persistent storage

===

Flexible: Instances can be stopped when not needed, and then started again
On-Demand

Storage volumes are always chared based on the amount of space that you actually provision, not necessarily use

Instance families: provide varying combination of hardware resources
	- General Purpose
	- Compute Optimized
	- Memory Optimized (e.g m5.large)
		m is the family name
		5 is the generation number
		large is the size of the instance
	- Accelerated Computing
	- Storage Optimized

===

Network interface

General 
	- Instances in public subnet have a private IP and public IP (dynamic address)
	- Instances in private subnet have private IP only 

ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
	- Basic Adapter type for when you do not have any high-performance requirements
	- Can be used with all instance types

ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)
	- Enhanced networking performance
	- Higher bandwidth and lower inter-instance latency
	- Choose supported instance type

EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)
	- HPC (High Performance computing) and MPI (Message Passage Interface) and ML use cases
	- Tightly coupled applications
	- Can use with all instance types

=== 

types of IP

Public IP


Private IP


Elastic IP


=== 

Storage

Elastic Block Store (EBS) directly attached to EC2 instances over the network

Criteria for selecting the storage class
- Durability
- Volumn Size
- Max IOPS
- Max Throughput
- Multi-Attach Support

=== 

Launch EC2 instances

key pair important to Windows (Remote Desktop Protocol)
For linux, connect to it via cloudShell (Secure Shell Protocol)

Set up security groups
	- Inbound rules
	- Outbound rules


=== 

Connect to EC2 instances

ping for testing
	- Check port 22 is enabled in security group or not
	- Have a public IP?


=== 

EC2 User Data & (Instance) Meta Data

Instance Meta Data Service (IMDS)
- IMDSv1 (older and less secure)
- IMDSv2 (newer, more secure, requires a session token for authorization)

User Data
The code runs when the instances starts for the first time (~script)
16Kb in raw-form, base64-encoded
Encoding is automatic with the console and AWS CLI

=== 

- Get the IMDSv1 data

Help
curl http://169.254.189.254/latest/meta-data/

Instance ID
curl http://169.254.189.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id

AMI ID
curl http://169.254.189.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id

Instance type
curl http://169.254.189.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type

- Get the IMDSv2 data

1. Create a session and get a token
TOKEN=${curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-ttl-seconds: 21600"}

2. Use the token to request metadata
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.189.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id


===

Access Keys and IAM roles with EC2

Use IAM role instead of IAM user to access the instance is more secured.


=== 

EC2 placement groups

Control how AWS deploy EC2 instances and place in availability zones

- Cluster
	pack instances close together inside an / the same availability zone
	achieve low-latency network performance -> tightly-coupled node-to-node communications
	for HPC (High-Performance Computing) application

- Partition
	spread instances across logical partitions
	do not share the underlying hardware 
	large distributed and replicated workloads

- Spread
	place a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures


=== 

NAT (Network Address Translations) for public addresses


===

Bastion Hosts (堡壘機) and Private Subnets


=== 

EC2 Pricing Options

- On Demand
	Standard rate, no discount, no commitments
	short term / unpredictable workloads

- Reserved
	Steady-state, 1 / 3 year commitments, up to 75% discount
	predictable workloads and reserved capacity

- Spot Instances
	Low price for unused capacity, up to 90% discount, may be terminated by AWS
	workloads with flexible start and end times

- Dedicated instances
	Physical isolation at the host hardware level from instances belonging to other customers (aka. not sharing hardware)
	pay per instance

- Dedicated Hosts
	Physical server dedicated for your use (Socket/core visibility, host affinity), pay per host
	workloads with server-bound software licenses

- Savings Plan
	Flexible pricing with commitment to a set spend over time

=== 

EC2 Billing criteria (General)

- The amount of time that your instances are running 
	billed per second, minimum of 1 minute
	for Amazon Linux, Windows, RHEL, and Ubuntu / Ubuntu Pro

- EBS Volumes also billed per second, minimum of 1 minute
	The capacity of volume is provisioned to use

- Linux distros hourly pricing, minimum of 1 hour 

EC2 Billing criteria (Reserved Instances)

- Standard Reserved Instances
	Can change availability zones, instance size, networking type 
	(ModifyReservedInstances API)

- Convertible Reserved Instances
	Can change availability zones, instance size, networking type + family, OS, tenancy, payment option
	(ExchangeReservedInstances API)

Cam pay All upfront, Partial upfront, no upfront

When the attributes of a used instance match the attributes of an reserved instances, discount is applied

=== 
EC2 On-Demand Capacity Reservations

Reserve compute capacity for EC2 instances in a specific availability zone
Any duration can be specified
Mitigates against the risk of being unable to get On-Demand capacity
Does not require any term commitments and can be cancalled at any time
- Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity
- The number of instances for which to reserve capacity
- The instance attributes (instance type, platform/OS...)

===

ML Capacity Blocks
ML model training and fine-tuning
ML experiments and prototypes

EC2 Pricing Use Cases



=== 

Exam Crams

- Key pairs are used to securely connect to EC2 Instance

- Storage is either Amazon EBS (persistent) / instance store (non-persistent)

- Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launched an instance
	template for the root volume for the instance
	Launch permission

- Instance metadata is data about your instance that you use to configure or manage the running instance

- User data is data that is supplied by the user at instance launched in the form of a script


- Advantages of EC2
	Elastic Computing: easily launch hundreds to thousands of EC2 instances within minutes
	Complete Control: Control instances with full access
	Flexible: Choice of instance type, operating system, software packages
	Reliable: Instances can be rapidly commissioned and replaced
